OrganizeWindows
===============

When executed multiple times, it alternates between performing `Show windows side by side` and `Undo Show side by side` operations.

Running this .exe is equivalent to manually right clicking the taskbar and selecting the appropriate operation, but this .exe can be assigned to a keyboard shortcut or a trackpad gesture.
